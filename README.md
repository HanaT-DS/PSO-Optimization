# PSO-Optimization
This is a SAS implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO is a stochastic optimization technique inspired by the collective behavior of birds flocking and fish schooling. Unlike gradient-based methods, PSO does not rely on derivatives, making it suitable for solving both linear and nonlinear optimization problems.
